This project aims to implement scalable LIDAR data processing through integration of [Liblas](http://liblas.org) with MPI. The main functions will be:
  * Point reclassification with raster masks
  * Gridding using various interpolation algorithms
  * Mask buffering to allow background data checks
  * Mask generation is where a lot of effort and heuristics is necessary
